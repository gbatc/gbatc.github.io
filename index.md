**Computer-Aided Topological Design&mdash;applications of computational topology in geometric design and processing**\
Computational topology is an emerging discipline developed since around 2000.  It studies the determination and modeling of topological 
problems in computer applications, as well as the design of algorithms for topological problems.  As a subject to apply computational 
topology to the field of data processing, topological data analysis has been developed.  It has been widely used in biomedicine, drug 
design, financial analysis, machine learning, and other fields.  The main tools in computational topology and topological data analysis 
are persistent homology and Mapper.  Persistent homology constructs a sequence of gradually “growing” simplicial complexes in a metric 
space, computes the persisting homological features (generators in the persistent homology groups), and infers the importance of the 
features based on the life span of these homological features, thereby enabling the inference and extraction of global topological 
features of the discrete data set.  On the other hand, Mapper extracts the main topological structure of the data set by defining a 
reference mapping on the data set and using data segmentation and clustering.  Since almost 10 years ago, the CAGD research group of 
Zhejiang University has applied computational topology methods to geometric design and geometric processing, and developed a series of 
computer-aided topological design methods.  This talk will introduce a series of work in this area, including curve and surface 
reconstruction technology based on topological understanding, and topological control methods in implicit curve and surface 
reconstruction.  Furthermore, persistent homology has been applied to the field of porous structure processing, and a variety of 
topological descriptors have been designed for porous structure retrieval and classification; porous structure generation technology 
that ensures connectivity has been developed; porous thickness computation technology that preserves topological structure and porous 
model slicing method have been proposed in 3D printing of porous structures.

**Graph-theory-based exploration of structural chemistry and material genes in Li-ion batteries**\
Methodologies of structural chemistry have been studied to explore the material gene and structure-function relationship in Li-ion 
batteries.  Through developing chemical methods based on graph theory as well as establishing a material big data system, we aim to 
incorporate artificial intelligence and investigate the fundamental questions of “what are material genes?” and “how to conduct research 
on material genes in lithium-ion batteries?”.  In this report, several cutting-edge interdisciplinary fields will be introduced, 
including structural chemistry based on graph theory, big data of materials, lithium-ion battery material genes, super-exchange 
interaction of d-orbital spinning electrons in transitional metals, structure characterizations via large scientific facilities such as 
synchrotron and neutron radiation, etc.  The above investigations attempt to inspire new paradigms for material research, thus advancing 
the development of critical materials in lithium-ion batteries.

**Mathematical AI for Molecular Sciences**\
Artificial intelligence (AI) based Molecular Sciences have begun to gain momentum due to the great advancement in experimental data, 
computational power and learning models.  However, a major issue that remains for all these AI-based learning models is the efficient 
molecular representations and featurization.  Here we propose advanced mathematics-based molecular representations and featurization.  
Molecular structures and their interactions are represented by high-order topological and algebraic models (including Rips complex, 
Alpha complex, Neighborhood complex, Dowker complex, Hom-complex, Tor-algebra, etc).  Mathematical invariants (from persistent homology, 
persistent Ricci curvature, persistent spectral, R-Torsion, etc) are used as molecular descriptors for learning models.  Further, we 
develop geometric and topological deep learning models to systematically incorporate molecular high-order, multiscale, and periodic 
information, and use them for analyzing molecular data from chemistry, biology, and materials.

**Advancing Speech Signal Processing: From Region-Based Audio Zooming to Near-Field Quality Transformation**\
Enhancing speech signals in complex acoustic environments remains a critical challenge in audio processing.  Our recent work presents 
several innovative approaches to tackle key issues in this domain.  We introduced a novel audio zooming technique based on deep 
learning, shifting from traditional direction-based beamforming to a user-defined, adjustable 3D region for sound capture.  This 
advancement enables precise and flexible audio acquisition, supporting real-time applications such as remote conferencing, education, 
and live streaming.  Building on the concept of region-based sound capture, we further aimed to transform the captured far-field audio 
into near-field quality.  Leveraging pre-trained generative models, we designed a method to resynthesize clean speech by reducing noise 
and reverberation, achieving robust performance in the real-world environments.  To refine this transformation, we used a two-stage 
framework combining predictive deep learning for initial enhancement with generative diffusion models for near-field audio generation.  
By optimizing the diffusion process, we significantly reduced computational complexity while enhancing audio fidelity and reducing 
distortion.  These advancements provide effective solutions to long-standing challenges in speech processing, enabling high-quality 
audio experiences in diverse applications.
