**Computer-Aided Topological Design&mdash;applications of computational topology in geometric design and processing**

Computational topology is an emerging discipline developed since around 2000.  It studies the determination and modeling of 
topological problems in computer applications, as well as the design of algorithms for topological problems.  As a subject 
to apply computational topology to the field of data processing, topological data analysis has been developed.  It has been 
widely used in biomedicine, drug design, financial analysis, machine learning, and other fields.  The main tools in 
computational topology and topological data analysis are persistent homology and Mapper.  Persistent homology constructs a 
sequence of gradually “growing” simplicial complexes in a metric space, computes the persisting homological features 
(generators in the persistent homology groups), and infers the importance of the features based on the life span of these 
homological features, thereby enabling the inference and extraction of global topological features of the discrete data 
set.  On the other hand, Mapper extracts the main topological structure of the data set by defining a reference mapping on 
the data set and using data segmentation and clustering.  Since almost 10 years ago, the CAGD research group of Zhejiang 
University has applied computational topology methods to geometric design and geometric processing, and developed a series 
of computer-aided topological design methods.  This talk will introduce a series of work in this area, including curve and 
surface reconstruction technology based on topological understanding, and topological control methods in implicit curve and 
surface reconstruction.  Furthermore, persistent homology has been applied to the field of porous structure processing, and 
a variety of topological descriptors have been designed for porous structure retrieval and classification; porous structure 
generation technology that ensures connectivity has been developed; porous thickness computation technology that preserves 
topological structure and porous model slicing method have been proposed in 3D printing of porous structures.

    <b>9:30 Prof. Feng Pan</b>, <i>Graph theory based exploration of structural chemistry and material genes in Li-ion batteries</i>
  </summary>
  Methodologies of structural chemistry have been studied to explore the material gene and structure-function relationship in 
  Li-ion batteries.  Through developing chemical methods based on graph theory as well as establishing a material big data 
  system, we aim to incorporate artificial intelligence and investigate the fundamental questions of “what are material genes?” 
  and “how to conduct research on material genes in lithium-ion batteries?”.  In this report, several cutting-edge 
  interdisciplinary fields will be introduced, including structural chemistry based on graph theory, big data of materials, 
  lithium-ion battery material genes, super-exchange interaction of d-orbital spinning electrons in transitional metals, 
  structure characterizations via large scientific facilities such as synchrotron and neutron radiation, etc.  The above 
  investigations attempt to inspire new paradigms for material research, thus advancing the development of critical materials 
  in lithium-ion batteries.

    <b>11:00 Prof. Kelin Xia</b>, <i>Mathematical AI for Molecular Sciences</i>
  </summary>
  Artificial intelligence (AI) based Molecular Sciences have begun to gain momentum due to the great advancement in 
  experimental data, computational power and learning models. However, a major issue that remains for all these AI-based 
  learning models is the efficient molecular representations and featurization. Here we propose advanced mathematics-based 
  molecular representations and featurization. Molecular structures and their interactions are represented by high-order 
  topological and algebraic models (including Rips complex, Alpha complex, Neighborhood complex, Dowker complex, Hom-complex, 
  Tor-algebra, etc). Mathematical invariants (from persistent homology, persistent Ricci curvature, persistent spectral, 
  R-Torsion, etc) are used as molecular descriptors for learning models. Further, we develop geometric and topological deep 
  learning models to systematically incorporate molecular high-order, multiscale, and periodic information, and use them for 
  analyzing molecular data from chemistry, biology, and materials.
